2.Joins
Joins is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. There are several types of joins, including inner join, left join, right join, and full outer join. 
Table 1: Customers
CustomerID CustomerName	  ContactName Country
1	     Alfreds        Maria	  Germany
2	     Ana Trujillo	  Ana	        Mexico
3	     Antonio	  Antonio	  Mexico
4	     Around the HornThomas	  UK
5	     Berglunds	  Christina	  Sweden
Table 2: Orders
OrderID	CustomerID	OrderDate
1	           3	2022-03-01
2	           1	2022-02-28
3	           2	2022-03-02
4	           2	2022-03-03
5	           3	2022-03-04
Inner Join
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
Output
CustomerName	OrderDate
Alfreds	      2022-02-28
Ana Trujillo	2022-03-02
Ana Trujillo	2022-03-03
Antonio	      2022-03-01
Antonio	      2022-03-04

3.Query from renaming a Table Column
ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN old_column_name TO new_column_name;

4.Query to find Duplicates
SELECT email, COUNT(*) as count
FROM employees
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

5.DISTINCT Statement
The way of using the Distinct Statement
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
uses - used to return only distinct (different) values.

6.Remove Dulpicates
duplicate records from a table by using the DISTINCT keyword in a SELECT statement or by using the DELETE statement with a subquery.
Query - Remove Dulpicates
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, column3
INTO new_table
FROM old_table;

7.Print max salary for a particular department
